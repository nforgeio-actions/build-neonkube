# build-neonkube

**INTERNAL USE ONLY:** This GitHub action is not intended for general use.  The only reason why this repo is public is because GitHub requires it.

Builds a neonKUBE solution, optionally including installers and code documentation.  Note that by default, the
action will succeed even when there are build errors.  Subsequent steps can use the **success** output to detect
the error in this case.

You can set the **fail-on-error** input to **true** to have the action step fail for build errors.  Note that the 
**success** and any other outputs will not be returned when the action fails.
