# build

**INTERNAL USE ONLY:** This GitHub action is not intended for general use.  The only reason why this repo is public is because GitHub requires it.

Builds the neonKUBE solution, optionally including installers and code documentation.  Note that by default, the
action will succeed even when there are build errors.  Subsequent steps can use the **success** output to detect
the error in this case.

You can set the **fail-on-error** input to **true** to have the action step fail for build errors.  Note that the 
**success** and any other outputs will not be returned when the action fails.
